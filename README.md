This is a Python code for a food ordering app. It includes functions for placing an order, viewing orders, user authentication, and admin functions.

The code starts by importing necessary modules including json and os. It then defines file paths for menu, users, and orders in JSON files and loads initial data from them.

The Order class has methods for placing an order and adding it to the order history. The place_order() method displays the menu and prompts the user to select food items and quantities. The order details are then saved in the orders.json file. The view_orders() function displays the order history for a given customer name.

The auth() function prompts the user to enter their email and password and returns True if it matches the admin credentials, otherwise False. The admin_function() allows the admin to perform actions such as adding, editing, viewing, and removing food items from the menu.

Finally, the register_user() function registers a new user and logs them in.
